Work in progress.

Experimental application to render exam questions grabed from a plaintext list or json and store in json. Usage: use the parser to process a text file in similar form as the example, where asterisk indicates correct answer and multiple carriage returns for spacing are ignored. Produces exam object which can then be saved into json and which, when project is done, will be able to be administered as pure python cgi, scored programmatically, save results to an appropriate datatype, and display individual results to student.
